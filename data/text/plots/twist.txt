The PCs must work alongside an NPC or organization they’d rather not pal around with (those who are normally rivals or villains, or just a snooty expert sent along to “help” them, etc). 
The victims are really villains and the villains are really victims. 
The PCs meet others who can help them, but won’t unless the PCs agree to help them with their own causes. 
The villain is somebody the PCs know personally, even respect or love (or someone they fall for, mid-story). 
The PCs must succeed without violence, or with special discretion. The PCs must succeed without access to powers, equipment, or other resources they're used to having. 
The villain is a recurring foil. 
Another group comparable to the PCs has already failed to succeed, and their bodies/equipment/etc provide clues to help the PCs do better.
There are innocents nearby that the PCs must keep safe while dealing with the adventure.
The adventure begins suddenly and without warning or buildup; the PCs are tossed into the fire of action in scene one.
The PCs must pretend to be someone else, or pretend to be themselves but with very different allegiances, values or tastes.
The PCs can’t do everything and must choose: which evil to thwart? Which innocents to rescue? Which value or ideal to uphold?
The PCs must make a personal sacrifice or others will suffer.
The PCs aren’t asked to solve the problem, just to render aid against a backdrop of larger trouble: get in a shipment of supplies, sneak out a patient that needs medical help, or so on.
One of the PCs is (or is presumed to be) a lost heir, fulfillment of a prophecy, a volcano god, or some other savior and/or patsy, which is why the PCs must do whatever the adventure is about.
There is another group of PC-like characters “competing” on the same adventure, possibly with very different goals for the outcome.
